Main requirements

The button lights are a service guarantee
    Once the light on a hall call button is turned on, an elevator should arrive at that floor                                                  | CHECK
    Similarly for a cab call, but only the elevator at that specific workspace should take the order                                            | CHECK

No calls are lost                                                                                                                               | NOT CHECK
    Failure states are anything that prevents the elevator from communicating with other elevators or servicing calls
        Losing network connection entirely
        Software crashes 
        Doors that won’t close
        Losing power to the elevator motor 
        Losing power to the machine that controls the elevator

        Network packet loss is not a failure, and can occur at any time                                                                         | CHECK
        An elevator entering the network is not a failure

    No calls should be lost in the presence of failures
        - For cab calls, handling loss of power or software crash implies that the calls are executed once service to that elevator is restored
        - The time used to handle (compensate for) these failures should be on the order of seconds not minutes

    If the elevator is disconnected from the network, it should still serve all the currently active calls (i.e. whatever lights are showing)
        It should also keep taking new cab calls so that people can exit the elevator even if it is disconnected from the network
        The elevator software should not require reinitialization (manual restart) after intermittent network or motor power loss

The lights and buttons should function as expected                                                                                              | CHECK
    The hall call buttons on all workspaces should let you summon an elevator                                                                   | CHECK                                                            

    Under normal circumstances, the lights on the hall buttons should show the same thing on all workspaces                                     | CHECK
        Normal circumstances means when there are no active failures and no packet loss
        Circumstances with packet loss or active failures should only cause a delay in proper light behavior                                    | CHECK

    The cab button lights should not be shared between workspaces                                                                               | CHECK   

    The cab and hall button lights should turn on as soon as is reasonable after the button has been pressed                                    | CHECK
        Not ever turning on the button lights because “no guarantee is offered” is not a valid solution
        You are allowed to expect the user to press the button again if it does not light up

    The cab and hall button lights should turn off when the corresponding call has been serviced                                                | CHECK

The door should function as expected                                                                                                            | NOT CHECK                            
    The “door open” lamp should be used as a substitute for an actual door                                                                      | CHECK
        The door should not be open (light switched on) while the elevator is moving                                                            | NOT CHECK
        The duration for keeping the door open when stopping at a floor should be 3 seconds                                                     | CHECK

    The obstruction switch should substitute the door obstruction sensor inside the elevator                                                    | CHECK
        The door should not close while it is obstructed                                                                                        | CHECK
        The obstruction can trigger (and un-trigger) at any time                                                                                | CHECK

An individual elevator should behave sensibly and efficiently                                                                                   | CHECK
    No stopping at every floor “just to be safe”                                                                                                | CHECK

    Clearing a hall call button light is assumed to mean that the elevator that arrived                                                         | CHECK 
    at that floor announces “going up” or “going down” to the user, and users are assumed to only enter an elevator moving in                   | CHECK
    the direction they have requested
        This means that a single elevator arriving at a floor should not clear both up and down calls simultaneously
        If the elevator has no reason to travel in the direction it has announced: clear call and wait for 3 new seconds                        | CHECK


Secondary requirements
These requirements will only be regarded if the system satisfies the main requirements.

Calls should be served as efficiently as possible
    • The calls should be distributed across the elevators in such a way that they are serviced as soon as possible

Permitted assumptions
The following assumptions will always be valid during testing:
    1. There is always at least one elevator that is not in a failure state
        a. I.e. there is always at least one elevator that can serve calls
        b. “No failure” includes the door obstruction: At least one elevator will be able to close its doors

    2. Cab call redundancy with a single elevator or a disconnected elevator is not required
        a. Given assumption 1, a system containing only one elevator is assumed to be unable to fail
        b. In a system containing more than one elevator, a disconnected elevator will not have more failures

    3. No network partitioning: There will never be a situation where there are multiple sets of two or more elevators with no connection between them 
        - Note that thisneeds 4 or more elevators to become applicable, which we will not test anyway

Unspecified behavior

Some things are left intentionally unspecified. Their implementation will not be tested and is, therefore, up to you.

How the elevator behaves when it cannot connect to the network (router) during initialization
    - You can either enter a “single-elevator” mode or refuse to start

How the hall (call up, call down) buttons work when the elevator is disconnected from the network
    - You can optionally refuse to take these new calls

What the stop button does
    - The stop button functionality (if/when implemented) is up to you

Recommendations
Start with 1 <= n <= 3 elevators, and m == 4 floors. Try to avoid hard-coding these values:
You should be able to add a fourth elevator with no extra configuration or change the
number of floors with minimal configuration. You do, however, not need to test for n > 3
and m != 4.
If you need to specify the identifier of an elevator when it starts, we recommend that you
implement the command-line switch --id <number>.
